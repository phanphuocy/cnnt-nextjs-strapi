He’s grown up a lot and shown he can be just as versatile with an electric keyboard as he is with a traditional piano~ I like the look and feel of this music video, it reminds me of my highschool years for some reason, I guess the colors and style are pretty reminiscent of the early 2000s, and I like how Thai songs are saying “I’m going to get you/be your man/love you…but only if you want me to” these days xD I guess that takes the edge off the otherwise creepy factor the lyrics of “no more greeting, I’m going to love you now, it’s okay” might carry
