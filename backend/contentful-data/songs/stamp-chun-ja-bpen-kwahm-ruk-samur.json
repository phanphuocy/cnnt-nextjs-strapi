Rather than explain the song from the point of view of two people getting back together or falling in love, he decides to tell it from the point of view of love itself, reminding us that love is always love, its meaning doesn’t change, it’s people who are trying to change their own perception of it. Love isn’t suffering, it isn’t pain, it isn’t sadness. Love is love, it’s always love, and all that other stuff comes from people doing other things.\nTo do the song justice, I’m glad it was partnered with a beautiful music video, guaranteed to leave you in tears; the girl was so close to getting an abortion after her boyfriend left her when he found out she was pregnant, but she looked past the anger and sadness she felt towards him and felt the love for her child and decided to keep her. Later, you also find out the guy and girl get back together, and the child is happy to experience the love from both parents, as well as the love they still have for each other.
