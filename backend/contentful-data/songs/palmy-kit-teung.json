Palmy has explored a variety of popular music styles on each of her four solo albums, and has collaborated with the Thai ska band T-Bone to create experimental renditions of her hits (see Flower Power Concert and The Acoustic Album.) Though her solo recording was Beautiful Ride in 2006, she has continued to perform live with T-Bone, and has appeared as a guest vocalist at other concerts and music festivals. She is primarily successful in Asian countries (especially Korea, Japan, Thailand and Singapore), but she has also performed in Australia and the UK.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"birthday":"1981-08-07","isBand":false}}],"genre":"pop","lyricsTh":"ทุกๆ สิ่ง นั้นเปลี่ยนไป เมื่อตอนลืมตาขึ้นมา และมองท้องฟ้าในตอนไหน\nTook took sing nun bplian bpai meua dtaun leum dtah keun mah lae maung taung fah nai dtaun nai\nEverything changes whenever I open my eyes and look up at the sky\nเหงาเหลือเกิน เมื่อเธอจากไป เหม่อมองพระจันทร์ทุกคืน ฉันคิดถึงเธอเกินทนไหว\nNgao leua gern meua tur jahk bpai mur maung prajun took keun chun kit teung tur gern ton wai\nIt’s so lonely when you’ve left, I stare at the moon every night, I miss you too much to bear\n\n(*) บางครั้งที่ใจอ่อนไหว น้ำตายิ่งบีบยิ่งคั้น ร้องออกมาเท่าไหร่ เธอรู้มั้ย\nBahng krung tee jai aun wai num dtha ying beep ying kun raung auk mah tao rai tur roo mai\nSometimes when my heart is weak, the more I hold back the tears, do you know how much I’ve cried?\n\n(**) แต่ละคืนที่มองไม่เห็นใคร อดทนไว้ หัวใจยังสั่น\nDtae la keun tee maung mai hen krai aut ton wai hua jai yung sun\nEach night that I don’t see anyone, I endure it, my heart still trembles\nแต่ละวันเดือนปีที่หมุนไป เธอรู้มั้ยว่าใครคิดถึงเธอ\nDtae la wun deuan bpee tee moon bpai tur roo mai wah krai kit teung tur\nEach day, month, and year that passes by, do you know someone misses you?\nตรงนี้ไม่มีเธอแล้ว แต่ย้ำ ทุกอย่างยังคงเหมือนเดิม ฉันคิดถึงเธอเหลือเกิน\nDtrong nee mai mee tur laeo dtae yum took yahng yung kong meuan derm chun kit teung tur leua gern\nYou’re not here anymore, but I repeat; everything is still the same, I miss you so much\n\nเพราะโอกาสที่เราเจอกัน แค่เพียงในยามค่ำคืน เวลาฉันนอนหลับตาฝัน\nPror ohgaht tee rao jur gun kae piang nai yahm kum keun welah chun naun lup dtah fun\nBecause the only chance we have to meet is just at night when I’m dreaming\nทุกๆสิ่ง ที่เราผูกพัน และฉันยังภาวนาเพื่อขอให้เธออยู่ตรงนั้น\nTook took sing tee rao pook pun lae chun yung pahwanah peua kor hai tur yoo dtrong nun\nEverything connects us, and I still pray for you to be right there\n\n(*,**,**)\n\n( เธอจะรู้บ้างมั้ย บ้างมั้ย บ้างมั้ย ฉันคิดถึงเธอเหลือเกิน ฉันคิดถึงเธอเหลือเกิน )\n(Tur ja roo bahng mai bahng mai bahng mai chun kit teung tur leua gern chun kit teung tur leua gern)\n(Will you know?

The song is your average “You’re gone now, but I still miss you” lyrics, but I like the music video portraying a young couple trying to survive a long-distance relationship, only to have the man killed by a mugger as he was returning to propose to the woman. The woman lives her life missing the man, until she finally passes away in her old age and finally they’re reunited in the afterlife~","likeCount":53614,"viewCount":6764752,"dislikeCount":842,"publishDate":"2019-02-22T09:59:52Z","similars":[{"url":"wqJsZYibWcI","slug":"palmy-saun-glin","titleEn":"Tuberose","titleRo":"Saun Glin","titleTh":"ซ่อนกลิ่น","duration":"314","likeCount":568396,"viewCount":124413231,"artistsIds":["XWvb1ogRWHyZvKdSeATC8"],"publishDate":"2018-10-19T11:00:01Z","dislikeCount":24524},{"url":"TBTI7_90o8U","slug":"palmy-stamp-gala-krung-neung","titleEn":"Once","titleRo":"Gala Krung Neung","titleTh":"กาลครั้งหนึ่ง","duration":"367","likeCount":81843,"viewCount":22555282,"artistsIds":["XWvb1ogRWHyZvKdSeATC8","6vbIx0S2qkvmsP2lgBPtQR"],"publishDate":"2015-03-18T03:38:11Z","dislikeCount":2781},{"url":"4jfbfTqqSQ0","slug":"klear-ruk-hai-dtai","titleEn":"Love To Death","titleRo":"Ruk Hai Dtai","titleTh":"รักให้ตาย","duration":"308","likeCount":79945,"viewCount":8797061,"artistsIds":["1Velg5t9UvYtUClbFvEtef"],"publishDate":"2020-06-18T13:00:14Z","dislikeCount":1118},{"url":"8OuDiz3fzuA","slug":"stamp-aep-dee","titleEn":"Really Well","titleRo":"Aep Dee","titleTh":" แอบดี","duration":"303","likeCount":340486,"viewCount":36519246,"artistsIds":["6vbIx0S2qkvmsP2lgBPtQR"],"publishDate":"2019-10-24T09:57:07Z","dislikeCount":5648},{"url":"EcFF9krZ22I","slug":"jetsetter-ying-mai-roo-ying-dtaung-tum","titleEn":"The More I Don’t Know, the More I Must Do","titleRo":"Ying Mai Roo Ying Dtaung Tum","titleTh":"ยิ่งไม่รู้ ยิ่งต้องทำ","duration":"359","likeCount":89710,"viewCount":22668890,"artistsIds":["1M1XdD7dmYFWT5arziOSiO"],"publishDate":"2017-09-08T13:01:01Z","dislikeCount":3240},{"url":"Z-qjxO_ZJKM","slug":"klear-sing-kaung","titleEn":"Thing","titleRo":"Sing Kaung","titleTh":"สิ่งขอ","duration":"330","likeCount":452194,"viewCount":245997636,"artistsIds":["1Velg5t9UvYtUClbFvEtef"],"publishDate":"2015-10-15T12:59:45Z","dislikeCount":24118},{"url":"Vw8cyN0Cucg","slug":"the-toys-mee-tur-took-wun-gor-oh-ni","titleEn":"Having You Every Day, Things are Okay","titleRo":"Mee Tur Took Wun Gor Oh Ni","titleTh":"มีเธอทุกวันก็โอนิ","duration":"201","likeCount":101731,"viewCount":10146959,"artistsIds":["7JYfQeppXxROUf9sxaNczx"],"publishDate":"2019-02-22T04:00:09Z","dislikeCount":1121},{"url":"EP4H44Zb7-8","slug":"jetsetter-kit-teung-tur","titleEn":"Badly","titleRo":"Kit Teung Tur","titleTh":"น้ำผึ้งพระจันทร์","duration":"379","likeCount":68576,"viewCount":10726356,"artistsIds":["1M1XdD7dmYFWT5arziOSiO"],"publishDate":"2016-05-17T13:00:03Z","dislikeCount":1541},{"url":"b4IlFPMY_6g","slug":"gun-napat-gaut","titleEn":"Hug","titleRo":"Gaut","titleTh":"กอด","duration":"261","likeCount":39146,"viewCount":5052521,"artistsIds":["3k9jKtxE2zFkTw3JXcil3p"],"publishDate":"2019-01-30T09:55:54Z","dislikeCount":993}],"lastUpdatedSimilars":"2020-07-02T08:20:09.892Z"}
