Palmy has explored a variety of popular music styles on each of her four solo albums, and has collaborated with the Thai ska band T-Bone to create experimental renditions of her hits (see Flower Power Concert and The Acoustic Album.) Though her solo recording was Beautiful Ride in 2006, she has continued to perform live with T-Bone, and has appeared as a guest vocalist at other concerts and music festivals. She is primarily successful in Asian countries (especially Korea, Japan, Thailand and Singapore), but she has also performed in Australia and the UK.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"birthday":"1981-08-07","isBand":false}}],"genre":"rnbsoul","lyricsTh":"ลมอ่อนพัดโชยมา น้ำตาก็ไหลริน\nLom aun put choy mah num dtah gor lai rin\nThe wind gently blows, my tears flow\n\nเหลือเพียงกลิ่นหัวใจ คลุ้งไปกับความเหงา\nLeua piang glin hua jai kloong bpai gup kwahm ngao\nAll that’s left is the scent of my heart, permeating with loneliness\n\nรักยังไม่จางไป ตรึงติดชิดดวงใจ\nRuk yung mai jahng bpai dtreung dtit chit duang jai\nMy love still hasn’t faded away, it’s stuck in my heart\n\nยังหอมรัญจวนชวนให้ฝัน\nYung haum runjuan chuan hai fun\nI still smell my longing, inducing me to dream\n\n\nเคยแอบแนบเคียงกาย อิงแอบมิรู้คลาย\nKoey aep naep kiang gai ing aep mi roo klai\nI was once stuck by your side, clinging tightly to you\n\nใต้เงาของแสงจันทร์ เย้ายวนไม่เลือนหาย\nDtai ngao kaung saeng jun yao yuan mai leuan hai\nUnder the reflection of the moonlight, my feelings are aroused, they haven’t faded away\n\nซ่อนเก็บไว้ข้างใน ตรงสุดลึกดวงใจ\nSaun gep wai kahng nai dtrong soot leuk duang jai\nI hide them inside, deep down in my heart\n\nถนอมเธออยู่ในนั้น\nTanaum tur yoo nai nun\nPreserving you in there\n\n\n(*) คงไว้ได้แค่กลิ่นที่ไม่เคยเลือนลา\nKong wai dai kae glin tee mai koey leuan lah\nAll that has survived is just the scent that has never faded away\n\nยังหอมดังวันเก่ายามเมื่อลมโชยมา\nYung haum dung wun gao yaum meua lom choy mah\nI still smell it like the old days when the wind blew\n\nทิ้งไว้เพียงอดีตที่ไม่เคยหวนมา\nTing wai piang adeet tee mai koey huan mah\nI only throw away the past that will never return\n\nซ่อนเธอไว้ในใจ\nSaun tur wai nai jai\nHiding you in my heart\n\n\nเจ้าดอกไม้ซ่อนกลิ่น หอมบาดลึกเกินใคร\nJao dauk mai saun glin haum baht leuk gern krai\nOh, tuberose, your scent cuts deeper than anyone\n\nหอมเกินหักห้ามใจ ทุกคราวต้องหวั่นไหว\nHaum gern huk hahm jai took krao dtaung wun wai\nYou smell too strongly to resist, every time, I’m shaken\n\nร้อยเก็บเจ้ามาลัย ทัดเธอไว้ในใจ\nRoy gep jao mahlai tut tur wai nai jai\nI put a hundred of you in a wreath and wear you in my heart\n\nเพื่อคงกลิ่นหอมไว้อย่างนั้น\nPeua kong glin haum wai yahng nun\nSo I can smell you like that\n\n(*,*)","credits":"เนื้อร้อง : ปาล์มมี่ , วีรณัฐ ทิพยมณฑล , พีระนัต สุขสำราญ\nทำนอง : ปาล์มมี่ , วีรณัฐ ทิพยมณฑล\nเรียบเรียง : อธิราช ปิ่นทอง , อธิชนม์ ปิ่นทอง , เจนวิทย์ จันทร์ปัญญาวงศ์ , กฤติธี แสงดี","deungdutjaisNote":"Palmy isn’t capable of a bad song~ The song title has a play on words, since it is literally the name of a tuberose flower, which is a very strong, distinct smelling plant, but literally the name means “hidden scent,” referring to the strong feelings she still holds for her former lover.
